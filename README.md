This project undertakes the analysis of RNA-sequencing of untreated mouse mammary tumours and mouse mammary tumours treated with letrozole only, PD-1 antibodies only, and a combination of the two. Mouse mammary tumours were used as a model for ER+ breast cancer to understand the molecular mechanisms behind PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Differentialy gene expression analysis was undertaken to compare control and treated mouse mammary tumours to determine how PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors affect tumour gene expression patterns.
